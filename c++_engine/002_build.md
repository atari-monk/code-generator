# Build with cmake

Generate files with py script and build with cmake:

## Next Steps After Running the Script:

1. **Build the Project**:
    - Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the `Engine` directory.
    - Run the following commands to configure and build the project:
        ```bash
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake ..
        cmake --build .
        ```
2. **Run the Executable**:
    - After building the project, you can run the executable (located in the `build` folder):
        ```bash
        ./GameEngine   # On Linux/Mac
        GameEngine.exe # On Windows
        ```

This will allow you to compile and run the generated C++ engine project!
